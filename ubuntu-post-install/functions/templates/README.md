## Function Templates

You can add more functions to install additional third-party apps by editing one of these templates or simply modifying one of the pre-existing function files.

When you do add (or remove) functions be sure to update the main [`thirdparty`](/functions/thirdparty) function to reflect those changes, else the script will fail.
